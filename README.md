# odin-recipes
This recipe website is an assignment of The Odin Project. By the end of this assignment I will have used the skills I've learned so far in the HTML segment of TOP.

After completing the project I have a simple recipe website containing three recipes including images. Feel free to try them all and let me know how they taste.

As part of The Odin Project's Cascade segment I've added some CSS styling to this project. It's not beautiful but I'm learning and hopefully it will look nicer as I progress.
